Claims Processing System
Overview
This project is a healthcare claims processing system designed to efficiently manage the submission, batching, and processing of medical claims between healthcare providers and insurance companies. It streamlines the workflow from claim submission to batch processing, with intelligent batching optimization to minimize processing costs.
Key Features

User Authentication & Authorization: Role-based access control for providers and administrators
Claim Submission: Submit medical claims with line items, specialties, and priority levels
Smart Batching Algorithm: Automatically groups claims into batches based on multiple factors
Batch Optimization: Rebalances batches to minimize processing costs before submission
Processing Scheduling: Manages insurer daily capacity and schedules batch processing accordingly
Notifications: Email notifications to insurers when new batches are created

System Architecture
The application is built on Laravel 11, using:

Laravel Breeze for authentication scaffolding
Inertia.js and Vue 3 for the frontend
SQLite database (configurable to use MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)

Models
The system is built around several key models:

User: Healthcare provider staff members or administrators
Provider: Healthcare organizations submitting claims
Insurer: Insurance companies receiving claims
Specialty: Medical specialties (e.g., Cardiology, Orthopedics)
Claim: Individual claim submissions with metadata
ClaimItem: Line items within a claim
Batch: Groups of claims for processing

Batching Algorithm
The intelligent batching system is the core feature of this application, designed to optimize claim processing efficiency.
Algorithm Overview

Batch Assignment

Claims are assigned to batches based on provider, insurer, and date
Each insurer has configurable batch size limits (min, max)
The system respects insurer preferences for batching by encounter date or submission date


Cost Calculation

Each batch has a processing cost calculated using several weighted factors:

Time of month factor (claims later in the month cost more to process)
Specialty efficiency factors (specific insurers handle certain specialties more efficiently)
Priority factors (higher priority claims cost more to process)
Monetary value factors (higher value claims cost more to process)
Batch size optimization factors (batches closest to optimal size are most cost-effective)




Batch Optimization

The system can rebalance batches before processing to minimize costs:

Small batches are merged when possible
Large batches are split when they exceed maximum size
Claims are redistributed to achieve optimal batch sizes




Processing Scheduling

Respects insurer daily processing capacity limits
Automatically schedules overflow for future days
Maintains FIFO (first-in-first-out) processing order



Algorithm Implementation Details
The batching algorithm takes the following approach:
phpCopy// When a new claim is created:
1. Find an existing open batch for the provider/insurer/date combination
2. If no batch exists, create a new one
3. Add the claim to the batch
4. Update the batch totals and recalculate processing cost
5. If the batch exceeds maximum size, create a new batch for future claims

// When calculating processing cost:
1. Consider time of month (claims later in month cost more)
2. Apply insurer-specialty efficiency factors
3. Apply claim priority multipliers
4. Apply monetary value scaling
5. Apply batch size optimization factors

// When optimizing batches:
1. Identify batches that are too small or too large
2. Attempt to merge small batches or move claims to achieve optimal sizing
3. Split oversized batches when necessary
4. Recalculate costs after rebalancing
The algorithm uses database transactions to ensure data consistency during batch operations, with error handling and logging for debugging purposes.
Setup

Clone the repository
Install dependencies:
Copycomposer install
npm install

Set up your environment:
Copycp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
touch database/database.sqlite

Development Notes

The application uses Laravel's standard MVC architecture
Inertia.js provides a seamless SPA experience while using server-side routing
The batching algorithm is encapsulated in a dedicated service class for maintainability
Database transactions ensure data consistency during batch operations
The system is designed with scalability in mind, using chunking for processing large datasets

API Routes
The application provides RESTful routes for claims and batches management:

/claims - List and create claims
/claims/{id} - View claim details
/claims/create - Submit a new claim
/batches - View all batches
/batches/{id} - View batch details

Command Line Interface
The application includes artisan commands for batch management:

php artisan claims:process-batches - Process all ready batches
php artisan claims:optimize-batches - Rebalance batches to minimize costs
